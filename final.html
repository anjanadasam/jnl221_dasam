			<p>New York City, a place known for its bustling energy and diverse population, is also the financial heart of the country. While Manhattan has been glorified with this description the real statistics of the economy remain hidden. One subway ride away is the Bronx, which has historically been the borough with the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the city. 
		</section>
			<p>Understanding unemployment and poverty trends is crucial to analyzing the trends in rates for the Bronx. Syracuse economic professor Peter Wilcoxen explains more on the correlation between the rates. “When the unemployment rate goes up, often it's people who have you know the least secure jobs who lose their jobs first.” Wilcoxen said. “Those tend to be people who have low income. And so when the unemployment rate goes up, the poverty rate usually goes up and vice versa.”
		</section>
			<p>Looking at the rate of unemployment overtime in the city overall, we can see that since 2014 there has been a rate that stayed at an average of 6 percent. During and after the pandemic, we see an increase in the rate of unemployment in the city, where we see a lot of that centered around the Bronx.

			<p>An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/nyregion/bronx-unemployment-covid.html">article</a> published by the New York Times featured a neighborhood in the Bronx called West Farms and highlighted their issues surrounding unemployment. The article stated “West Farms has become an epicenter of New York’s economic crisis, one of the hardest hit urban communities in the country and emblematic of the pandemic’s uneven toll.”
		<section>
			<p>When you compare the Bronx with other boroughs, there is a sizable difference in the poverty and unemployment rates. The data gathered from the <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/">New York City Environment and Health Portal</a>
reveals almost double the average percent of poverty and unemployment in the Bronx compared to Manhattan.

			<p>It’s been reported from The Bronx Daily that <a href="https://bronx.com/poverty-in-the-bronx-a-deep-rooted-and-pervasive-problem/">one in three</a>
 people live below the poverty line. This issue in the Bronx is evident, so why has this borough been stuck on a poverty cycle despite its close proximity to Manhattan? 
			section>
		<section>
			<p>Wilcoxen explains how one of the leading factors includes low educational attainment. The Bronx has an “unusual” high rate of people that have no college or high school degree. 28 percent of adults that are 25 years or older had an education that ended earlier than a high school graduation, which is almost twice than the usual amount when compared to the rest of the city, according to Wilcoxen. 
		<section>
			<p>“So the educational levels limit people's job prospects, so that leads to higher unemployment and obviously lower earnings and higher poverty” Wilcoxen said. 
		<section>
			<p>He also goes to explain that the lack of education is in correlation with the number of immigrants that tend to settle down in the Bronx. 
		<section>
			<p>“So it's not that it's not that everybody in the Bronx drops out,” Wilcoxen said. “It's just that a lot of people who arrive in the US end up living in the Bronx, and many of them are refugees and other people who don't have a lot of formal education.” 
		<section>
			<p>In addition to the lack of higher education attainment, affordable housing plays a factor into the high rates. The Bronx Daily reports that due to the <a href="https://bronx.com/poverty-in-the-bronx-a-deep-rooted-and-pervasive-problem/">lack of affordable housing</a>
, many are forced to live in “overcrowded or substandard conditions”. In turn, this impacts health and wellbeing, making it more difficult to find jobs. 
		<section>
			<p>With the conditions the Bronx faces daily, with the data to prove it, the New York State government has worked to improve these conditions. After the pandemic, rates like unemployment and poverty have taken a toll in many places. Which also caused the state to pay more attention to the already existing challenges faced in the Bronx. According to Wilcoxen, the poverty rates are still pretty high after the pandemic, and that right now there are a lot of anti-poverty policies that are in place to help remedy the high rates. 
		<section>
			<p>While government action is slowly taking into effect, there are many local organizations working to improve these conditions. <a href="https://www.nycommunitytrust.org/">New York Community Trust</a>
 organization has offered services like preserving affordable housing and designing better housing for homeless residents. They also provide emergency food services and have a food-distribution hub in the Bronx that brings more local food produce to the city. To combat high unemployment rates, they work to connect workers with good jobs that promote fair wages and working conditions. 
		<section>
			<p>With more organizations like these, and more policies in effect we can hope to see more change in the rate of unemployment and poverty in the Bronx. NYC is a place people move to for opportunities, and the goal being to move those opportunities more North towards areas and residents that need the benefits. With more action, we can only hope to see those changes in the next few years.
